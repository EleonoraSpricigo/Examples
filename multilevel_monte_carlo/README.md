- [Fluid dynamics building problem](use_cases/fluid_dynamics_building)
- [Wind engineering rectangle problem](use_cases/wind_engineering_rectangle)
    - [Deterministic wind engineering rectangle problem with ensemble average approach](use_cases/wind_engineering_rectangle/deterministic_ensemble_average)
    - [Stochastic wind engineering rectangle problem](use_cases/wind_engineering_rectangle/stochastic_MC)
    - [Stochastic wind engineering rectangle problem with ensemble average approach](use_cases/wind_engineering_rectangle/stochastic_MC_ensemble_average)
- [Wind engineering CAARC problem](use_cases/wind_engineering_CAARC)
    - [Steady inlet wind engineering CAARC problem with ensemble average approach](use_cases/wind_engineering_CAARC/deterministic_steady_inlet_ensemble_average)
    - [Turbulent inlet wind engineering CAARC problem with ensemble average approach](use_cases/wind_engineering_CAARC/deterministic_turbulent_inlet_ensemble_average)

## Validation Cases
- [Elliptic benchmark](validation/elliptic_benchmark)

## Remarks
- In case running with `PyCOMPSs` gives errors, try to replace relative paths with absolute paths, as first attempt to fix the issue.
