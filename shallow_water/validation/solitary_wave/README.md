# Propagation of a solitary wave

**Author:** [Miguel Maso Sotomayor](https://github.com/miguelmaso)

**Kratos version:** 9.0

## Case Specification
This examples analyzes the propagation of a solitary wave along a 200m long and 1m width channel. The  The analytical solution can be found in Nwogu (1993) and Wei and Kirby (1995).

The solitary wave is characterized by a water depth of 1m and an amplitude about 0.1m. It has been generated by imposing the analytical solution at the left end of the channel.

## Results
The water depth is monitored at several points from the left boundary, at x=20m, 50m and 150m. The time series of the wave at those points can be seen at Figure 1.
