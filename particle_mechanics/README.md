# Particle Mechanics Examples

This folder contains examples related to the [Particle Mechanics Application](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/ParticleMechanicsApplication) implemented in Kratos-Multiphysics. 

## Instruction
- Please follow the instruction to download and install the latest version of the application and the GiD interface, [here](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/ParticleMechanicsApplication). 
- At the moment, we only support [GiD](https://www.gidhome.com/) for pre- and post-processing.
- For unit testings of the currently available feature, please visit the [tests](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/ParticleMechanicsApplication/tests) folder in Particle Mechanics Application.

## Examples

The examples are continuously updated and extended along with the development of Kratos.

### Validation
 - [Granular Flow 2D](validation/granular_flow_2D/README.md)
 - [Cylinder on inclined plane](validation/cylinder_on_inclined_plane/README.md)

### Use Cases
