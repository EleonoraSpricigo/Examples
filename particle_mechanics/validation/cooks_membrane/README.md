The
[Particle Mechanics Application](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/ParticleMechanicsApplication) of Kratos is used to perform this example.


## Case Specification

The Cook's membrane test under the assumptions of plain strain is presented. This test is used to check the mixed element formulation (U-P) under incompressible conditions.
The material considered is the hyperelastic one and the properties are:
* Density (_&rho;_): 1000 Kg/m<sup>3</sup>
* Young's modulus (_E_):  70 Pa
* Poisson ratio (_&nu;_): 0.499


The problem geometry as well as the boundary conditions are sketched below:

The problem is solved with a structured mesh of triangle elements with 3 material points per cell, and with 32 elements per size.

## Results

The results shows how the U-P formulation prevent the pressure oscillation issues in the mean stress field.
