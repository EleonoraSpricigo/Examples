## Case Specification

This example is taken from [Kuzmin, D. (2010). Unsteady Transport Problems. In A Guide to Numerical Methods for Transport Equations (pp. 180â€“184). Section 4.4.6.3].

We solve the transient convection equation
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} %2B v \cdot  \nabla \phi %2B \phi \nabla \cdot v - \nabla \cdot k \nabla \phi = f">, where null diffusivity <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k"> is considered. Specific initial conditions are set, we refer to the above reference for further details.

The problem is solved exploiting the **Runge-Kutta 4 time integration explicit method**, and it can be run with four different stabilizations:
* quasi-static algebraic subgrid scale (QSASGS)
* quasi-static orthogonal subgrid scale (QSOSS)
* dynamic algebraic subgrid scale (DASGS)
* dynamic orthogonal subgrid scale (DOSS)

## Results

We present the temporal evolution of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\phi"> for the *DOSS* case.

We can observe the results we obtain are consistent with the reference [Donea, J., & Huerta, A. (2003). Finite Element Methods for Flow Problems. Section 5.6.1]. Moreover, we observe the solution peak is not being diffused in the domain, as one should expect for a pure-convection problem.
