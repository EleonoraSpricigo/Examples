## Applications used

All the examples shown here use the following applications of Kratos:

* LinearSolversApplication
* FluidDynamicsApplication
* StructuralMechanicsApplication
* PoromechanicsApplication

## Source files

Any example of the Poromechanics Application has a source folder containing all the necessary files to run the case. Some of the files are used by the GUI of GiD and others are used by Kratos. The most important ones are the following:

* MainKratos.py: is the main script of the example. We call it from python to run the case.
* _example\_name_.mdpa: contains information of the _modelpart_. Lists the material properties, the nodes, the elements, the conditions and the _submodelparts_.
* ProjectParameters.json: saves the parameters of the example such as the dimension, the time step or the linear solver, and also lists the processes used in the example.

## How to run the examples

There are two different ways for running an example of the Poromechanics Application: using python from the terminal, and using the GUI from GiD.

**Run the example from the terminal**

*Linux/macOS*

Open a terminal, go to the source folder of the case and type:

>
    python3 MainKratos.py

*Windows*

First create a "run.bat" file inside the source folder of the example. It should contain the path of the installed Kratos libs and the order to run the python script. If Kratos is installed in C:

> set PATH=C:\\KratosInstall;C:\\KratosInstall\\libs;%PATH%
>
> C:\\KratosInstall\\runkratos MainKratos.py

After that, open a Windows command line, go to the source folder of the case and call the "run.bat" file to run the case:

>
    run.bat

**Run the example from GiD**

Ona can also run any example using a GUI based on the "problemtype" modules of GiD [https://www.gidhome.com](https://www.gidhome.com).

First copy the folder [Poromechanics_Application.gid](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/PoromechanicsApplication/custom_problemtype) inside the problemtype folder of GiD.

After that, copy all source files of the example inside a new folder named "_example\_name_.gid".

Open the latter folder from GiD and you will be able to modify the boundary conditions, the properties, or the solver settings of the example, mesh the geometry and run the case.
